This is a project to create the code for Dash Callbacks and make a functional dashboard.

The callbacks will connect two core components (dropdown & radio buttons) to a DataTable.

The core components will be used to show different data in the table. Functionally, it will work similar to how a pivot table works in Excel.
Start with a large list >> apply filters on the left panel >> the link shrinks to see which rows pass the criteria.

Long-Term Goal = Add more core components and features to create a similar functionality to this site: https://tools.finra.org/fund_analyzer/search?q=Vanguard
